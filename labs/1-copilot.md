# Creating Copilot with your Codespace

In this hands-on lab you will use Codespaces and Copilot to utilize the benefits that Copilot gives to developers writing code. Good luck! üëç

This hands on lab consists of the following steps:

- [Creating first codespace](#creating-first-codespace)
- [Add devcontainer and devcontainer json file](#add-devcontainer-and-devcontainer-json-file)
- [Code with Copilot](#code-with-copilot)
- [If time permits add additional methods](#if-time-permits-add-additional-methods)

## Creating first codespace

1.	Work inside your current repository `<org-name>/<repo-name>`
2.	Under the repository name, use the Code drop-down menu, and in the Codespaces tab, click Create codespace on main.

3.	Wait for the codespace to spin itself up. Note, it‚Äôs a VM spinning up in the background.
4.	Once your codespace is created, your repository will be automatically cloned into it.

## Add devcontainer and devcontainer json file

1.	Inside your codespaces Add a `.devcontainer` folder and `devcontainer.json` in the root of your Repo
2.	Click "Add File"
3.	Click "Create New File"
4.	Type or copy paste.

```
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```
5.	In the body Add the following customizations.

```
	{
	  "name": "Codespace to bootstrap GitHub Action Importer in a Codespace",
	  //Use base codespace image then pull GitHub Action Importer on postCreateCommand,  
	  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/universal:linux",
	  "remoteEnv": {
	    "DOCKER_ARGS": "--network=host",
	    "INSTALLATION_TYPE": "labs"
	  }
	  ,    
	  // Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
	  "customizations": {
	      "vscode": {
	          "extensions": [
	              "GitHub.copilot"
	          ]
	      },
	      
	  }
	}
    
 ```
 
 6.	Save the changes, then on the right corner you will see the notification to Rebuild the container. Just click on the Rebuild Now.

7.	Wait for the codespace to spin itself up. Note, it‚Äôs a VM spinning up in the background.
8.	Then The copilot extension should show up in the VS code extension list.
9.	On the bottom right of the screen there should be a Copilot icon. Hover over the icon.

## Code with Copilot

1. Add a new files in VSCode called `Bootcamp.cs`

4. Accept the code suggestion.

## If time permits add additional methods
